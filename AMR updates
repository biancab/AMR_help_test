AMR GUIDELINES - UPDATES
________________________________________
This document presents issues that have been resolved recently, but which have not yet been added to the current version of the AMR Guidelines. We will do our best to make the necessary updates as soon as possible.

The changes/updates up to this point are:

•  If the sentence contains a “yes/no” answer to a previous question/statement, then “yes/no” are omitted from the annotation, e.g.:

<code>(t / true</code>
  <code>:domain (t2 / that))</code>

"Yes , that is true."

•	In case of negative indefinite pronouns like “nobody”, “no one”, “nothing”, you should use the surface forms of the pronouns (and not break down into polarity – and positive pronoun form, e.g. anything :polarity -), e.g.:

(s / sleep-01
:arg0 (n / no-one))

no one is sleeping

(n / nobody
:arg1-of (l / like-01
:arg0 (i / i)))

there is nobody that i like

•	The generic pronoun “one” should be annotated as a concept in itself and not be normalized to “person”, e.g.:

(r / recommend-01
  :ARG1 (t / try-01
          :ARG0 (o / one)
          :ARG1 (t2 / this)))

One should try this.

•	If you have structure like “to me/you …” (meaning “in my/your opinion”), the you should use opine-01, e.g.:

(o / opine-01
  :arg0 y
  :arg1 (e / engineer
          :domain i
          :mod only))

To you, I am only an engineer.

•	At the moment, the sentences should be considered self-contained and annotated as such. This means annotating only the content within the boundaries of the sentence. However, if elliptic nature of the sentence would lead to an incomplete/inaccurate annotation, the previous sentence(s) should be considered. E.g.:

Case 1:

    Previous sentence: He said, "Yes.
    Current sentence: That's true.

>> In this case the content of the second sentence suffices and concepts from the previous sentence are not needed.

Case 2:

    Previous sentence: Wait?
    Current sentence: For what?

>> In this second case, the predicate wait-01 from the previous sentence is needed in order to correctly reflect the argument structure implied by “for”:

(w / wait-01
  :ARG2 (a / amr-unknown))


•	If the sentence contains exclamations reflecting a person’s emotions, then you should use :mode expressive

E.g.: outch!, wow!, hmm, oh, d'uh! etc.

:mode expressive doesn’t cover onomatopoeia or other interjections.

•	If you encounter the prefixes “anti-” and “pro-”, you should use the following to annotate them

>> oppose-01 – for political/opinion use of “anti”, as in “an anti-Syrian journalist” (i.e. journalist who opposes Syria)
>> counter-01 - when there is an implied action/force (destroy, prevent), as in “anti-virus program”

For some verbs, there is a core :ARG already available, as in “an anti-Assad fighter”: 

person 
     :ARG0-of fight-01 
            :ARG1 Assad

>> favor-01 (for “pro”), as in “pro-road position”

•	The epistemic use of “must” should be annotated as follows:

    (i / infer-01
      :ARG1 (s / sick
                 :domain p)
      :ARG2 (b / be-located-at-91 :polarity -
                 :ARG1 (p / person :name (n / name :op1 "John"))
                 :ARG2 (h / here)))

“John isn't here, he must be sick.”
